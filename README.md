The following commands are useful for navigating the Linux file system:

* `cd`: Changes the current directory.
* `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory.
* `pwd`: Displays the current working directory.

**Example:**

To change to the `home` directory, use the following command:

```
cd ~
```

To list the contents of the `home` directory, use the following command:

```
ls
```

To display the current working directory, use the following command:

```
pwd
```

**Slide 6: File and Directory Management**

**Creating, moving, and deleting files and directories**

To create a file, use the `touch` command.

```
touch myfile.txt
```

To create a directory, use the `mkdir` command.

```
mkdir mydir
```

To move a file or directory, use the `mv` command.

```
mv myfile.txt mydir
```

To delete a file, use the `rm` command.

```
rm myfile.txt
```

**Understanding file permissions (chmod)**

Every file and directory in Linux has a set of permissions. These permissions control who can read, write, and execute the file or directory.

To view the permissions for a file or directory, use the `ls -l` command.

```
ls -l myfile.txt
```

To change the permissions for a file or directory, use the `chmod` command.

For example, to make a file writable for everyone, use the following command:

```
chmod 664 myfile.txt
```

**Slide 7: Package Management**

**Introduction to package managers (e.g., APT for Debian/Ubuntu)**

A package manager is a tool for installing, updating, and removing software on Linux systems.

One popular package manager for Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, is APT.

**Installing, updating, and removing software**

To install a package using APT, use the following command:

```
sudo apt install packagename
```

To update all installed packages, use the following command:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

To remove a package using APT, use the following command:

```
sudo apt remove packagename
```

**Slide 8: User Accounts**

**Creating and managing user accounts**

To create a new user account, use the `adduser` command.

The following shell script creates a new directory and then changes to the new directory:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Create a new directory
mkdir mydir

# Change to the new directory
cd mydir
```

To run this script, save it as a file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `create_dir.sh`) and then make the file executable by running the following command:

```
chmod +x create_dir.sh
```

To run the script, simply type the following command:

```
./create_dir.sh
```
